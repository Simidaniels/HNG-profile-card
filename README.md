# HNG-profile-card
The HNG Internship Profile Card project demonstrates the application of semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create an accessible and visually appealing user interface. It effectively showcases my profile, including hobbbies and dislikes, social links, and the current time in ms, while maintaining clean structure and testable code through the use of data-testid attributes. Overall, the project highlights practical frontend development skills, attention to accessibility, and readiness for collaborative software engineering tasks within the HNG Internship framework.
